Hello.
This is an info site of sorts, and it will host some of my projects in the future (once I figure GitHub out) -D
# bio
I used to be a motion designer (on Scratch lol), and now I'm trying to become an indie developer. 
Not old enough to have a job, not young enough to justify being on Scratch.
You can find me at:
scratch.mit.edu/users/WavingShock (sometimes)
https://github.com/waveboi243 xd
pixilart.com/waveboi
waveboi.info@gmail.com
Also, I use cyclops faces --> -)
